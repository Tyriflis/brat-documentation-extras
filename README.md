Some helpful tips I have learned while using the Brat annotation tool

DISCLAIMER: I am in no way an expert on brat, I simply want to share some of the things I have learned while working with Brat, trying to explain these things in a way that is hopefully easy to understand.

A lot of information about Brat is scattered, and some information is in the code itself. I want to describe some of the things that have been useful for me and for the project I am working on.
